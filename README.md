# LionArt
To run our website locally: python server.py

Please note that any uploaded images must be jpg's and have the file extension in their name. 

We have provided a folder called /test-imgs with test imgs so that you can easily test our website

We referenced the lecture notes from the flask lecture to write server.py. We also referenced the lecture notes from the javascript/html
lecture. We also consulted stack overflow when we were having trouble linking out html views together on our local server. We referenced
stack overflow for other small html, css, and js issues as well.

All screens are easily accessible via their URLS though:
